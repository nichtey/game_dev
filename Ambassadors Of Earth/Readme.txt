Game Mechanics:

AOE is a turn based card game that challenges players to make decisions based on the needs and resources available to their colonies. Decisions would have an impact on events that may follow, and would determine if the colony thrives.

Backstory:

Starting in the ice age, you must rebuild a colony low on food and on the brink of revolt. With little starting resources, you must make wise choices that will chart your colony's future. Because you never know, some decisions will have lasting consequences that may even be felt in the following years.

As your colony amasses wealth and power, however, humans will begin to pose a challenge. Will you fight against them or work with them to build a better tomorrow? The choice and responsibilities rest on your shoulders. May you always stay true to the cause and be the ambassador for Earth's future.
